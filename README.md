Beyond 101 App Challenge

Hi Everyone,
This course is part of a App Challenge of the Coursera Course: "Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps"
A couple of course members have started working on a Zelda like game
to which eventually different type of games will be linked and we welcome you to join!

Whether you are an advanced programmer or first time LibGDX user, doesn't matter.
Even if you know very little to nothing about LibGDX we'll help you on your way.
I think this is a great way to start learning more in a hands-on kind of way & we are helping each other out by exchanging & sharing knowledge, resources, links etc.

We've set up a team/chat room on Slack (https://slack.com/) for communication.
And we are using the project management tool Asana for outlining and appoint different tasks that need to be done to.
Team members can pick there own favorite tasks and work according to their own speed.
You can do as much or as little as you want.

If you are interested sent me a message @ rikvanvelzen [at] yahoo _ com
